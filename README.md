Lab Overview
Distributed with this lab is a source tree that includes a small amount of Java code and some Web content. Download and run this app, but realize it does not do much of anything right now. Your target application is deployed at http://lead2.poly.asu.edu:8090/lab4part3/. Visit this application in your web browser and get a feel for the functionality it currently provides.

You are to build a small fictional new site for NEW News Inc. New News provides news stories for casual and subscribed readers alike. It also provides a community reporter interface, where any registered reporter in the field can provide news stories. The main functionality centers around a content management system, with flavors of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for various roles. There is some backend starter code however that you must use without modification.
