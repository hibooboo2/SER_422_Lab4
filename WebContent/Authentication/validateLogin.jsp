At this point you would know whether you had a successful login or not, and
if so have a UserBean representing the existing user. If the login works (same
userid and password), but the user does not exist, then you should ask if a
new user should be created and under which role (subscriber or reporter).
NOTE: You do not have to keep this logic in a JSP. In fact you shouldn't!
